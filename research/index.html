        <li> "Roads and Retail Consumption"
        <P>  Abstract: This paper explores the impacts of transportation infrastructure on U.S. retail markets. The identification strategy relies on the variation in historical transportation infrastructure. Using detailed scanner data, I examine the effects of U.S. interstate highways on a set of outcomes related to consumer welfare. First, I find that interstate highways reduce prices and expenditures on retail goods and improve the quality of goods purchased by consumers. Secondly, interstate highways not only increase the supply of unique products in stores but also the variety of products purchased by consumers. Third, the results imply that the presence of online retail markets distorts the effect of interstate highways on physical retail markets. Lastly, I find that interstate highways reduce the cost of living in the retail sector for both low and high-income consumers. Counterfactual analyses show that interstate highways improve consumer welfare in the retail sector.

        <li> "Regional Price Indexes and Stimulus Payments Allocation"
        <P>  Abstract: To illustrate the importance of differences in the cost of living across US households on the real impacts of the federal tax and transfer system, this paper examines a counterfactual policy that adjusts the 2020 stimulus payments based on regional and household group-specific price indices.  My analysis identifies regional and group-specific price indices by estimating demand functions derived from a model of consumer choice with non-homothetic preferences using detailed barcode-level data. The results reveal significant variation in the real impact of stimulus payments.  For example, to have the same real impact, the nominal value of a stimulus payment to a household in California would need to be about twice the amount as a payment to household with the same income but living in West Virginia.

        <li> "Uniform Brand Variant Pricing and Cost Pass-Through to Retail Prices", with Danna Thomas 
        <P>  Abstract: We document extensive uniform pricing of brand variants within U.S. grocery stores and explore how cost shifting to retail prices is impacted by this pricing behavior. Specifically, through both a theoretical framework and empirical models of pass-through we consider cost shifting in two cases: (1) the cost shock is common to all brand variants, (2) the cost shock is specific to a subset of brand variants. First, we find that either type of cost change increases the prices of all brand variants identically regardless of whether a brand variant was directly exposed to the cost shock or not. Second, we show that pass-through after a cost shock that applies to all brand variants is greater than pass-through after a cost shock that applies to only a subset of brand variants. Thirdly, we demonstrate that the magnitude of pass-through for a product-specific cost shock depends on that product's market share.
